			]<h3>Educational Improvement Tax Credit (EITC)</h3>
		</center>
<h4>Not only does the Pennsylvania Educational Improvement Tax Credit program allow taxpayers to know where their tax dollars are going, but it also allows them to decide where their tax dollars will be sent.</h4>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Tax Credit Programs (SPE)</h3>
</center>
<h4>Through a recent amendment to PA state law, individual taxpayers can now participate in Pennsylvania’s EITC program by allocating their Pennsylvania personal tax liabilities to a Special Purpose Entity of their choice. A special purpose entity has been created for Philadelphia Classical School in order to provide individuals interested in supporting our mission the ability to do so using their personal tax liabilities.</h4>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Who Can Participate in This Program?</h3>
</center>
<h4>Individuals with a tax liability of at least $(___) per year are eligible to apply for the program.</h4>
<br>
<br>

<h3>How Does This Benefit Philadelphia Classical School?</h3>
</center>
<h4>This program ensures that your tax dollars will make a difference in the life and education of our students. The tax credits provide PCS with the opportunity to give scholarships to students in need.</h4>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<h3>What’s in it for Me?</h3>
</center>
<h4>By supporting PCS, you become a crucial part of our mission in bringing Christ-centered Classical education to a city in need. Aside from having the privilege of using your tax dollars in a way that you determine, you are also eligible to report this as a Federal charitable contribution and claim the credit on your tax return.</h4>
